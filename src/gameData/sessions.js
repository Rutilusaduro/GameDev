  cheerleader:[
    s=>`${s.name} stops you after floor check-in — not with a question, just to talk. "You're different from other RAs," she says. She doesn't elaborate, but she smiles when she leaves. You notice she's started sitting closer to the front.`,
    s=>`She's waiting outside the lounge when you arrive. Not for anything specific. "I just wanted to talk," she says, already making herself comfortable in the chair across from you. She stays for forty minutes and eats the snacks you have out without asking.`,
    s=>`"I don't really think about it anymore," ${s.name} says one afternoon, smoothing her hands over her enormous thighs with quiet familiarity. "I just know that whatever you suggest is usually right." She leans forward, full of trust. "So what do you suggest?"`,
  ],
  bookworm:[
    s=>`${s.name} starts leaving annotated reading printouts on your desk — things she thinks you'll find interesting. Her notes are in careful handwriting in the margins. You start leaving responses.`,
    s=>`She brings you coffee without asking. Black, the way you take it. You don't remember telling her that. She just knows, the way she knows most things — by watching carefully and making notes.`,
    s=>`${s.name} closes her laptop when you walk in — both of them. "I've been thinking," she says, "that I trust your judgment more than my own on certain things." She says it matter-of-factly, like a research finding. "I wanted you to know that."`,
  ],
  swimmer:[
    s=>`${s.name} leaves her training log on your desk — splits, meal timing, notes in the margin about "off day hunger." You start writing back.`,
    s=>`She brings you a protein shake without asking. The flavor you mentioned once in passing. She tracks everything, including what you like.`,
    s=>`${s.name} towels off after morning laps and finds you in the hall. "I trust your read on this more than mine," she says, like it's a race strategy. "Tell me what to do with the appetite."`,
  ],
  influencer:[
    s=>`${s.name} mentions you in a post — vague, complimentary. "My RA says" something kind. The comments say "you love her." She messages you the link privately: "Thought you'd like that."`,
    s=>`She stops filtering her posts when you're around. "You're one of the only people I can just be with," she says. For her, being unguarded is the intimacy. She doesn't reach for her phone the entire afternoon.`,
    s=>`${s.name} turns down a sponsored deal. "Not aligned," she says. The product was about restriction and she isn't doing that anymore. "You've made me different," she says. "Better, I think."`,
  ],
  athlete:[
    s=>`${s.name} asks if you want to eat together after floor check-in — just lunch, nothing formal. She piles the tray high without noticing. "I just figured you'd be heading to eat anyway," she says.`,
    s=>`She calls you just to talk. She does that now. The call goes long. She eats her protein bar and a second one. "You're the only one who gets it," she says eventually.`,
    s=>`${s.name} comes to you first now — for everything. "You're the only one who gets it," she says, dropping her bag and settling into the couch. She takes up a lot of it now. Neither of you mentions it. It's simply how things are.`,
  ],
  artsy:[
    s=>`${s.name} shows you a sketchbook page marked DO NOT SHOW. "But you can," she says. "You're different." The drawing is of her own hands, relaxed, holding something. You think you understand.`,
    s=>`She starts leaving small drawings on your desk. A coffee cup with your initial. A window with rain. They're not signed. She doesn't mention them. You start keeping them.`,
    s=>`"I've been painting us," ${s.name} says, not looking up. On the canvas: a table, two chairs, food, warmth. Her figure is enormous and rendered with obvious tenderness. "It's how I see it. I wanted you to see it too."`,
  ],
  gamer:[
    s=>`${s.name} adds you to her Discord — the small private server, six people total. "Don't make it weird," she says, then talks to you for three hours. "You're actually cool," she finally says, like this surprises her.`,
    s=>`She sends links without context — memes, clips, screenshots. Each one lands exactly right. "I'm just good at people," she says. "You're easy." She's been paying very close attention.`,
    s=>`${s.name} names an NPC after you in a game she's building. "You're the good one," she says. "Always has food, never judges." She shows you the sprite. It's accurate. "I wanted to put you somewhere permanent."`,
  ],
  sorority:[
    s=>`${s.name} introduces you to her closest sisters as "basically family." Casually, like it's established. When you leave she catches your arm. "I meant that," she says quietly. Then back to being loud, as if nothing happened.`,
    s=>`She confides something real — not gossip, something she's actually worried about. She picks at the snacks between sentences. "You're the first person I've told," she says. She finishes the whole plate before she realizes.`,
    s=>`${s.name} quits one of her committees. "The culture wasn't right." She means one of the places that used to make her feel bad about eating. She doesn't say that. You understand anyway. "Things are better now. You're part of that."`,
  ],
  overachiever:[
    s=>`${s.name} asks for your opinion on her season plan — not competitively but genuinely. She takes notes. "You think differently than I expected," she says. It might be the most honest compliment she gives anyone.`,
    s=>`She revises her season plan around feedback you gave her in passing. Not for a grade. "I just needed it to be right," she says. She hands you thirty pages. She'd clearly spent a weekend on it. "I trust your judgment."`,
    s=>`${s.name} drops one of her majors. "Three was too many," she says — which everyone has been telling her for two years. "You made me see that." She looks lighter, even though she's heavier. "I want to do fewer things properly."`,
  ],
  quiet:[
    s=>`${s.name} leaves a note on your desk — not a message, just a drawing of a bird she saw on campus. No explanation. It's small and precise and somehow says everything. You put it in a drawer. She notices it's gone. She smiles.`,
    s=>`She starts sitting beside you when she studies, in silence. After a while she says, "I don't usually do this," meaning be close to anyone. "I know," you say. She nods. That's enough.`,
    s=>`${s.name} speaks up in the common room for the first time — not hesitantly, but with something to say. Afterward she looks at you. Not for approval. Just sharing. "Thank you," she says once, later. She doesn't say for what. You know.`,
  ],
  transfer:[
    s=>`${s.name} stops calling this place temporary. "I think I belong here," she says, surprised. You've noticed her routes on campus have changed — longer, more comfortable, lingering. "It's because of you, partly," she says.`,
    s=>`She brings you food from a restaurant she found, just leaving it with a note: "You have to try this." Local, generous, good. She takes you there herself the following week. "This is home now," she says. She means it.`,
    s=>`${s.name} applies for permanent residency in the city. "I'm staying," she says, like it's the simplest thing. She's grown into this place in every way — rounder, slower, easier in her skin. "Why would I leave?"`,
